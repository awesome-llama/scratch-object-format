A prototype format allowing the representation of hierarchical data like what JSON can do, but in a way that is very easily readable by Scratch. 
Only requires 1 list.
Supports Arrays, Dictionaries, and Strings. 
Both arrays and dicts can be nested through the use of a Pointer, which is just an index into the data list. These are what the letters A, D, S and P stand for.

It was decided not to differentiate data types like numbers since scratch converts them automatically when needed and it would be a more complicated implementation.
